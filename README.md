# Dereverb_algos
This repo covers implementation of existing and under-development Dereverberation Algorithms for dereberbing sustained vowels.

A large corpus(~2,00,000) of Sustained Vowels(based on Timit dataset) was synthesised using KLATT synthesiser. The synthetic vowel corpus was then reverbed using 12 different RIRs based on small

, medium and large room with 4 different angles namely, near Angle A, near Angle B, far Angle A, far Angle B. 

The reverbed sustained vowel corpus will then be dereverebed using various dereverbing algorithms and effects of reverberation subsequent dereverberation on Formant frequencies of vowels.
